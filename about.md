title: About me

Hi, my name is Guillaume (just call me "*G*").

I am a **freelance Software Engineer** / **Configuration Management 'consultant'** based in Johannesburg (South Africa).

I hail from [Martinique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martinique), a French speaking island in the Caribbean.

I am a big fan of Functional Programming (yay [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/)) and DevOps (yay [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)) but more importantly **I like to keep things simple, easy to understand and easy to use**.

I am currently working remotely for [Snell Advanced Media](https://s-a-m.com/), a cool media company based in the UK where I work on backend systems, Web Apps and deploy (rather complex) things with Ansible.

I've given numerous talks at conferences and Meetups on topics such as Scala, Ansible, Property-based testing, and more recently Machine Learning.

You can always find me on Twitter ([@gbelrose](http://www.twitter.com/gbelrose)) or on a various Slack teams ([ZA Tech](http://zatech.co.za), [Elm]( https://elmlang.slack.com/)) or ping me at <kafecho@gmail.com>.
