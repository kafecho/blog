Software is a general purpose tool and can be used for solving many problems. For the past 8 years, I've mostly worked on software applied to broadcast technology (and mostly on back-end system to aid video production). Here are some of the projects I've been involved with recently.

[**SAM Go!**](https://s-a-m.com/products/go!-browser-based-timeline-video-editor/c-24/p-188) **Go!** is an innovative web-based video editing product which is 100% based on Web standards. Please make sure to check the [demo video](https://vimeo.com/202900375) as it is very interesting. I did a lot of JavaScript development focusing on the video and audio processing features.

[**SAM LiveTouch**](https://s-a-m.com/products/replayhighlights-livetouch/c-24/p-184). LiveTouch is a software and hardware product used for high quality replays for live sport events. I worked on a light-weight service which allows video operators to quickly search and share video fragments. The work was done with Scala, HTML5, JavaScript. 

**Video Processing in Scala**. I developped a bunch of tools (mostly Scala and Akka) for handling high bitrate commercial grade video streams (the stuff that comes out of a satellite feeds). I also did some research work in collaboration with BBC R&D on using IP-based protocols for video content production. See [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/ip-studio) for more information on what the BBC has been doing in that space.

**DevOps stuff**. I developped an extensive set of Ansible playbooks and roles for deploying clustered software components (CouchDB, SolrCloud, Zookeeper, HAProxy, Keepalivd) in highly resilient environments. This works includes the fully-automated deployment of monitoring stacks involving Icinga2, InfluxDB and Grafana. Most of the work is closed source, but I contributed back to the open source community with some work on Apache CouchDB.

I built a fully automated Continuous Delivery pipeline using Ansible, Maven, Jenkins, Vagrant. The pipeline implements the CD pipeline principles as described in [Jez Humble and Dave Farley's Continuous Delivery book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321601912?tag=contindelive-20).
