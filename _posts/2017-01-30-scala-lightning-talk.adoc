= Another Scala intro.

I gave yet another Scala intro talk at the Java Jozi JUG.

It had been a while since my last Scala talk, and while preparing for it, I realized how my Scala coding style has changed over the years.

The 2017 edition definitely has a strong *Functional Programming* flavour.

The slides are very high level and cover a tiny spectrum of the language. There are here: {site-url}/assets/presentations/scala-in-15-minutes-jozi-jug-30-01-2017.pdf
